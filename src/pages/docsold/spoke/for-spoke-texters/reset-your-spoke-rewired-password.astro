			<p>
				If you've forgotten your password, follow these steps to
				troubleshoot:
			</p><ol>
				<li>
					Navigate to your Spoke Rewired webpage and click "Login and
					get started."&nbsp;<img

						style="width: 778px; display: block; margin: auto;"
						alt=""
					/>
				</li>

				<li>
					From this page, click where the text reads "Forgot your
					password?" under the LOG IN button.&nbsp;<img

					/>
				</li>

				<li>
					Input your email and click "Request Reset." This reset
					request could take up to 15 minutes. Navigate to your email
					to open the password reset link. You will then be able to
					reset your password and access Spoke.&nbsp;<img

				</li>
			</ol><h4>Cannot Find Reset Email</h4><p>
				If you have not received&nbsp;the password reset link, look to
				see whether you may have registered on Spoke using a different
				email address. This is a common error.&nbsp;Search for
				"no-reply@spokerewired.com" in all of your email addresses to
				identify the email with an active spoke account.&nbsp;
			</p><p>
				If you find messages from Spoke Rewired in another email
				address, navigate to your Spoke webpage and restart the above
				process with the correct email address. Once you have opened the
				password reset link and have access to spoke, you can change
				your email address by clicking the gray bubble with your initial
				in the top right hand corner and then clicking on your name.
				This will bring you to the account settings page.&nbsp;
			</p><p>
				If you have further questions or difficulties updating your
				account info, email support@spokerewired.com for further
				assistance. In your email, please indicate the URL of the Spoke
				page you are attempting to access.&nbsp;
