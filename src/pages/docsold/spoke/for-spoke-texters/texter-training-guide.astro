        the newest version
      </p><p>
        This training will teach you to navigate Spoke Rewired, our peer-to-peer
        text messaging tool. Spoke is a powerful web-based texting platform that
        allows you to do rapid outreach to mobilize your members, turn out
        voters, build your base, and more.
      </p><p>When texting with Spoke, you have two goals:</p><ol>
        <li>Engage contacts efficiently and thoughtfully</li>

        <li>Log accurate data according to contacts' responses</li>
      </ol><p>
        These goals are equally important, and we’ll explain how they fit into
        the Spoke workflow in the Sending Responses section. We recommend
        reviewing each section of this training guide to prepare for your first
        texting shift.&nbsp;
      </p><p>Welcome!</p>

        Whether using your computer, tablet, or smartphone, sending text
        messages in Spoke is quick and easy. When beginning your texting shift,
        you should do the following:
      </p><ol>
        <li>
          Start by checking your team's texting guide and any announcements or
          instructions from your texting leaders.
        </li>

        <li>
          Create your account. Your texting leaders will send you a link that
          will invite you to your texting workspace. Once your account setup is
          complete, you will either see a text request form or a message
          indicating that no texts are available. If you see <em
            >Ready to text?
          </em>and the green <a
            href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/41-request-texts"
            target="_blank"><em>Request More Texts</em> button</a
          >, you can request your first assignment!<em>&nbsp;</em>Your texting
          leaders have set the maximum amount of texts you can request per
          batch; feel free to start smaller while you are getting to know the
          system, but know that batch sizes smaller than 300 are unlikely to
          provide many immediate replies!<img

        </li>
        <li>
          &nbsp;Once your text request has been approved, you will see your
          first assignment. Click on <em>SEND FIRST TEXTS</em>&nbsp;to enter the
          conversation screen. The green bubble indicates the number of texts
          you’ve been assigned.<img

        After sending your first assignment, you can begin <a
          href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/36-send-texts"
          target="_blank">responding to contacts' replies</a
        >. Recipients will respond over time, sometimes hours or even days later
        &mdash; Aim to check your workflow for replies a few times throughout
        the day to ensure everyone who responds to your initial text receives a
        reply from you.&nbsp;
      </p><ol>
        <li>
          As replies come into your workflow, you’ll see a <em>SEND REPLIES</em
          >&nbsp;button appear. The number in the orange bubble indicates the
          number of replies that need your attention. Unless you need to reopen
          a conversation that has already taken place, feel free to disregard
          the <em>PAST MESSAGES</em>&nbsp;or <em>SKIPPED MESSAGES</em>section.
          Any messages in the <em>SEND LATER</em>&nbsp;bucket will reopen when
          it reaches 9am in those contacts' local time zone. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Note:</strong> Conversations will only appear in your workflow
          between 9am-9pm local time for the recipients. If outside of that window,
          you will not be able to respond to contacts until texting hours reopen.
          Inbound replies from your contacts will appear the next morning.&nbsp;
          <img

          <p style="text-align: center;" style="text-align: justify;">
            After clicking the <em>SEND REPLIES</em>button, you’ll see the first
            reply in your queue. See the following section for instructions on
            marking the survey according to contacts' responses.&nbsp;<img
              src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f3fb0b61ff5d5f24f9abc5/file-qet697zecs.png"

          </p><p style="text-align: center;" style="text-align: center;"></p><h3
            style="text-align: center;"
          >
            MARKING SURVEY RESPONSES
          </h3>
        </li>
      </ol><p>
        Remember: Engaging in a positive conversation with your contacts is
        equally important to logging accurate data for your campaign or
        organization. When responding, first ask: Which survey response most
        accurately captures their response to my question?
      </p><p>
        <br /> Click on the survey question below <em>Current question</em>
      </p><p>
        <img
          src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f3fcd06d67192dc61b9aed/file-mXV00jGdhf.png"
        />
      </p><p>
        Read all responses carefully to ensure that your choice most accurately
        reflects their response. For example, note that the survey below
        includes two distinct options for wrong numbers, <em>Wrong number</em
        >&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Wrong number / Supports CANDIDATE</em>. You would
        want to choose the latter if the recipient had responded "This is not
        Adelaide, but I love CANDIDATE! They have my vote!"
      </p><p>
        <img
          src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4000b829a3853b69257fb/file-yKxsQOVPZx.png"
        />
      </p><p>
        If a contact clearly and explicitly asks to no longer receive texts, you
        must immediately <a
          href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/73-opt-out-a-contact"
          target="_blank">opt them out</a
        >.&nbsp;
      </p><p><strong> Common opt-out responses:</strong></p><ul>
        <li>“Lose my number.”</li>

        <li>“Remove me.”</li>

        <li>“Don’t text me.”</li>

        <li>“Take me off your list.”</li>

        <li>“Unsubscribe.”</li>
      </ul><p>
        Opt Outs are a system feature that prevents your team from ever
        contacting that phone number again. Follow the instructions of your
        texting leaders, but do not opt contacts out unless they clearly ask to
        be removed.
      </p><p>
        <img
          src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f401ea4181f8597e7d1402/file-tEOTn7QSw4.png"
        />
      </p><p>
        To opt a contact out, use the orange <em>OPT OUT</em>&nbsp;button at the
        bottom of your screen. An <em>unsubscribed</em> message will pre-populate;
        click send to complete the opt out. To opt a contact out without sending
        a message, delete the prepopulated response and hit <em
          >Opt out without sending message.
        </em>This is recommended if the contact responds with something like, "I
        better not receive one more message from you!" but it is best practice
        and highly recommended to send the <em>unsubscribed</em
        >&nbsp;notification.
      </p><p>
        <img
          src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4035a6d67192dc61b9b22/file-2keiIKU8jJ.png"
        />
      </p><p>
        Sometimes the contact asks a question rather than directly responding to
        the initial message. If possible, mark the survey response accurately
        but tailor the message to address their question. To find suggested
        replies to common questions, check <a
          href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/74-use-canned-response"
          target="_blank">the CANNED RESPONSES section</a
        > to the right of the <em>OPT OUT</em>&nbsp;button.
      </p><p>
        <img
          src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4043e80fd5a31e7ad106e/file-pO5AutvG4b.png"
        />
      </p><p>
        Clicking on a canned response will automatically populate the message
        field. If the contact has not addressed the initial question and it
        feels appropriate to do so, you could use a canned response and then
        reiterate the initial ask.
      </p><p>
        <img
          src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f405bb6d67192dc61b9b2f/file-Cgqk8XGCNr.png"
        />
      </p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><br /> APPLYING TAGS</h3><p>
        In addition to survey responses, data can also be captured through the <a
          href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/58-add-tags-to-a-conversation"
          target="_blank">application of tags</a
        >.&nbsp;
      </p><p>Tags are commonly used to:</p><ul>
        <li>Indicate that the recipient speaks another language.</li>

        <li>
          Escalate a conversation to another team or texting leader.&nbsp;
        </li>

        <li>
          Log data that doesn't naturally fit into the script, e.g. <em
            >I want a yard sign!</em
          >
        </li>
      </ul><p>
        To apply a tag, click <em>MANAGE TAGS</em> at the bottom of your screen.
      </p><p>
        <img
          src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4072e6d67192dc61b9b3f/file-WhAI0wz53P.png"
        />
      </p><p>
        <br /> In the example above, tagging "Spanish" would allow your texting leader
        to reach out to that contact in their first language the next time around.
        Depending on your program, you may also have the ability to tag <em
          >"</em
        >Reassign to Spanish Speaker" and actually pass that conversation to a
        Spanish-speaking teammate &mdash; just by applying the tag!&nbsp;
      </p><p>
        To find a tag, place your cursor under <em>Apply tags</em
        >&nbsp;and&nbsp;begin typing. The list will filter to the available tags
        as you begin typing.
      </p><p>When the tag appears, select it and click <em>SAVE</em>.</p><p>
        <img
          src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4178c61ff5d5f24f9ac9b/file-6xNFCR7pIT.png"
        />
      </p><p>
        From the <em>MANAGE TAGS</em>&nbsp;section, you also have the option to <a
          href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/81-escalate-a-conversation"
          target="_blank">escalate a conversation</a
        > directly to your texting leaders.&nbsp;This button should be used with
        care and according to your team's specific instructions. Texting programs
        often use this button to transfer messages directly to administrators because
        they contain:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Threats of violence</li>

        <li>
          Deadnaming, i.e. when a contact identifies as trans or non-binary but
          your organization's data contains their old, dead name
        </li>

        <li>
          Urgent requests. e.g. a canvassing volunteer who is having trouble
          finding an event location
          <p>
            <img
              src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4181e829a3853b692588f/file-jA2p8rLEnA.png"
            />
          </p><p>
            In general, you should only escalate as the final recourse to an
            extremely sensitive or urgent conversation.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul><h3 style="text-align: center;">NAVIGATING CONVERSATIONS</h3><p>
        If a voter sends a message that doesn’t require a response, you <a
          href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/80-close-conversation"
          target="_blank">can simply select CLOSE</a
        ><em>,&nbsp;</em>next to the <em>MANAGE TAGS</em>&nbsp;button.&nbsp;This
        essentially marks the message as “read” and will move it out of your <em
          >SEND REPLIES</em
        >&nbsp;section and into your <em>SKIPPED MESSAGES</em>.
      </p><p>
        <img
          src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4192f80fd5a31e7ad1112/file-hVwqa6Ywu9.png"
        />
      </p><p>
        To leave a reply "unread" so you can come back to it later, you should
        instead use the NEXT&nbsp;<strong>&gt;</strong>&nbsp;button on the
        bottom right of your screen. Unlike the <em>CLOSE&nbsp;</em>button,
        this&nbsp;will allow you to continue working on other replies and easily
        come back to an unanswered conversation.
      </p><p>
        <img
          src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/62f4199661ff5d5f24f9acae/file-PLIdD0Ft4R.png"

      </p><h3></h3><h3></h3><p>
        When texting on behalf of a campaign or organization, you should
        consider what each message you send&nbsp;would look like if it appeared
        on social media without context. Would it reflect well on the program
        you're supporting? Would other volunteers be proud to say they work
        alongside you? When responding to sensitive, unpleasant, or triggering
        messages, ask yourself: “What would it look like if my text conversation
        went viral?”&nbsp;

        Almost every text list will put you in touch with non-supporters or even
        trolls who use offensive language to try to bait you into saying
        something you’d regret. To safeguard ourselves against this, here are a
        few tips to help when you find yourself in a heated situation:
      </p><ol>
        <li>
          Disengage: Take a break from texting by walking away from your screen
          to recenter yourself around the goal of your work. Taking a breather
          can help you collect your thoughts and refocus.
        </li>

        <li>
          Lean on survey responses: Make use of the pre-scripted responses to
          quickly move past negative responders and onto potential supporters.
        </li>

        <li>
          Reach out to texting leadership:&nbsp;Don't hesitate to ask for help
          from your teammates and leadership. They can help you craft a
          thoughtful response or even take a conversation off your hands.

        <strong>Q</strong>: Do I need to download an app in order to use Spoke
        on my phone?
      </p><blockquote>
        <strong>A:</strong> Nope! Spoke is a web-based platform. You can access your
        workflow through your browser (Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
        and pasting your workflow url in the search bar.
      </blockquote><p>
        <strong>Q</strong>: Will using Spoke on my phone share my personal phone
        number with the contacts I’m texting?
      </p><blockquote>
        <strong>A:</strong>No. Spoke is a web-based program that assigns an
        anonymous phone number for each of our campaigns, so your personal
        number is always private.
      </blockquote><p>
        <strong>Q</strong>: What does it mean when I see a gray box with <em
          >SEND LATER</em
        >&nbsp;in Spoke?
      </p><blockquote>
        <strong>A:</strong>Spoke enforces sending during 9am-9pm local time. If
        it's outside of these hours for the person you're attempting to contact,
        you won't be able to send them a message.
