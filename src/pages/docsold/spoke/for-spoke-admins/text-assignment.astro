			<p>
				Assignments are discrete batches of text messages
				(conversations) to be allocated to texters. There are two
				different ways to assign conversations to texters: manually or
				automatically.&nbsp;
			</p><h2>Manual Assignment</h2><p>
				Administrators can manually assign texts to individual texters
				from either the <strong>Texters</strong>window of the campaign
				settings page or from the <strong>Message Review</strong> page off
				of the&nbsp;administration <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards"
					target="_blank">dashboard</a
				>. Depending on how many texters you are managing with manual
				assignment, this can be a very time-intensive process. We
				typically recommend using auto-assignment, unless you have a
				special case that requires manual assignment.
			</p><h2>Auto-Assignment</h2><p>
				<a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/111-auto-assignment"
					target="_blank">Auto-assignment</a
				> allows texters to request a preset number of conversations (either
				initial messages or unhandled replies) from the <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form"
					target="_blank">request form</a
				> on the texter <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards"
					target="_blank">dashboard</a
				>.&nbsp;
			</p><p>
				Auto-assignment can be set up two different ways:&nbsp;
			</p><ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Approval Required:</strong>Where each assignment
					request must be manually approved by an Administrator or <a
						href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/6-user-roles"
						target="_blank">Supervolunteer</a
					> in order for texters to receive their texts.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Auto Approve:</strong>Where requested assignments
					are automatically approved, allowing texters to start
					texting contacts within moments of submitting their request.
				</li>
			</ol><p>
				Determine the default setting for auto-assignment in the <strong
					>Settings</strong
				> page of&nbsp;the&nbsp;administration dashboard.&nbsp;
			</p><p>

				/>
			</p><p>
				To expedite the assignment process, we typically recommend
				setting the default to Auto Approve.&nbsp;You can also edit
				the&nbsp;auto-assignment setting of a specific texter in
				the&nbsp;<strong>People</strong>&nbsp;page
				of&nbsp;the&nbsp;administration dashboard.
			</p><p>
				Once you've set the default setting for auto-assignment, you can
				enable autoassign for specific campaigns&nbsp;within the <strong
					>Autoassign Mode</strong
				>&nbsp;window of the&nbsp;campaign settings page. You can then
				release texting assignments from those campaigns to your texters
				via the <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form"
					target="_blank">request form</a
				>, using the <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/66-manage-assignment-control"
					target="_blank"><strong>Assignment Control</strong></a
				> page of the&nbsp;administration dashboard.
