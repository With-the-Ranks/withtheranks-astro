			<p>
				Building a <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/25-campaigns"
					>campaign</a
				> lets you reach out to your contacts in a systematic and scripted
				way. Spoke administrators and owners are able to create campaigns
				from the Spoke administration <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards"
					>dashboard</a
				>.
			</p><p>
				After you create and start a campaign, you can continue editing
				all information <u
					><b>with the exception of the contact list.</b></u
				>  You must set up your VAN integration before creating a new
				campaign - for more information, see VAN Integration &amp; List
				Loading. (link) To &quot;add&quot; contacts to a campaign,
				duplicate the campaign by selecting <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/112-copy-a-campaign"
					>Copy Campaign</a
				> from the individual campaign page and load new contacts into the
				duplicate campaign.
			</p><br /><p>
				Note: some options are not available when using the Basic
				builder mode. To switch to Advanced mode and configure all
				settings, click on the <i><b>Builder Mode</b></i> dropdown menu at
				the top of the page.
			</p><br /><p>
				To build a new campaign, use the following steps:
			</p><h3><b>Step 1: Initiate a new campaign</b></h3><p>
				From the Campaigns page of the administrator dashboard, click
				the <b>plus (+)</b> button in the lower right corner, and click on
				<i><b>Create Blank</b></i> (the pencil icon). This will pull up a
				new campaign settings page.
			</p><p style="text-align: center;" class="align-center">

					style="max-width: 100%; text-align: center;"
				/>
			</p><br /><p>
				You can also duplicate an existing campaign by selecting <b
					>Copy Campaign</b
				> from the individual campaign page. This will often be the more
				efficient option.
			</p><br /><p>
				For more information about copying campaigns, see <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/112-copy-a-campaign"
					target="_blank">Copy a Campaign</a
				>.
			</p><br /><h3><b>Step 2: Enter campaign information</b></h3><p>
				The first window in the campaign settings page is called <b
					>Basics</b
				> and includes fields for basic campaign information. Enter values
				for the following fields:
			</p><ul>
				<li>
					<b>Title</b> — <span>required</span> — This title will be visible
					to texters and will be used for email notifications and for naming
					export files. Campaign titles can be useful for the <a
						href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/69-bulk-script-editor"
						>bulk script editor</a
					> or for your own analyses and record keeping, so you should
					group similar campaigns according to a carefully considered naming
					convention.
				</li><li>
					<b>Description</b> — <span>required</span> — This field can be
					used to include instructions, additional information, or even
					an inspirational message for your texters.
				</li><li>
					<b>Due Date</b> — <span>required</span> — The date on which the
					campaign &quot;ends.&quot; After this date, texters cannot send
					initial messages for this campaign, though they can still respond
					to replies as long as the campaign is not archived. Setting a
					<a href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/60-due-dates"
						>due date</a
					> can ensure, for example, that you never recruit for an event
					after the event date has passed.
				</li><li>
					<b>Intro HTML</b> — <span>optional</span> — The HTML that is
					displayed to texters as part of the assignment banner.
				</li><li>
					Logo Image URL — <span>optional</span> — The URL for an image
					that is displayed to texters as part of the assignment banner.
					&lt;add file formats&gt;
				</li><li>
					<b>Primary Color</b>— <span>optional</span> — The color that
					is displayed to texters as part of the assignment banner. Use
					the slider to choose a color, or enter a hex color code.
				</li>
			</ul><p>
				When you are finished, click the <i
					><b>SAVE AND GOTO NEXT SECTION</b></i
				> button.
			</p><br /><h3>Step 3: Set texting hours</h3><p>
				To set texting hours:
			</p><ol>
				<li>Open the<b> Texting Hours</b> window.</li><li>
					Enter a start time. Use a 12-hour time, such as 9 am.
				</li><li>
					Enter an end time. Use a 12-hour time, such as 9 pm.
				</li><li>
					Select a default timezone to apply to contacts without ZIP
					codes.
				</li><li>Click<i><b> Save</b></i>.</li>
			</ol><p>
				Note: In order to comply with regulations regarding consumer
				telephone contact, texting cannot start before 9am local time
				and must end no later than 9pm local time. Spoke will
				automatically honor the timeframe you set relative to the
				uploaded zip code of each contact. We recommend ending your
				texting by 8:30pm local time to ensure deliverability within the
				allowable texting hours.
			</p><br /><p>
				For more information, see <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/48-texting-hours"
					>Texting Hours</a
				>.
			</p><br /><h3>Step 4: Import contacts to the campaign</h3><p>
				From the <b>Contacts</b>window, perform the following steps:
			</p><h5>To Import a CSV:</h5><ol>
				<li>
					In the<i><b> Contact Source</b></i> menu, select <b>CSV</b> from
					the drop down menu.
				</li><li>
					Click <i><b>Select a File</b></i> or drag and drop the file into
					the dotted-line rectangle.
				</li><li>
					Locate the contact-list CSV file and click <i><b>Open</b></i
					>.
				</li><li>
					After uploading a csv file, a popup menu will appear
					allowing you to map the column headers of your csv to the
					required column headers (First Name, Last Name, and Cell
					Phone), as well as map the optional headers (Zip and
					External ID).
				</li><li>Click <i><b>Save</b></i>.</li><li>
					<span>Optional</span> — Exclude contacts who also appear as contacts
					within another campaign.<ol>
						<li>
							Start typing the name of the campaign you want to
							use for filtering (or open the drop-down menu).
						</li><li>Click the campaign name in the list.</li>
					</ol>
				</li><li>
					Repeat until you&#39;ve finished adding the campaigns you
					want to exclude.
				</li><li>
					Then hit <i><b>Save</b></i>. The name of your csv will now
					appear in the file upload box with a green background,
					indicating a successful upload.
				</li>
			</ol><br /><p>
				For more information and images about uploading your CSV
				contacts list file, see <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/64-contact-lists"
					>Contact Lists</a
				>.
			</p><p><b>To Import a list from VAN:</b></p><p>
				<span
					>(You must already have your VAN integration set up. To do
					this, see
				</span>
				<a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/93-van-list-loading"
					>VAN Integration &amp; List Loading</a
				>.)
			</p><p>
				For VAN lists, you cannot filter out contacts that are also in
				another campaign.
			</p><ol>
				<li>
					Select <b>Integration</b> from the<i
						><b> Contact Source</b></i
					> menu.
				</li><li>
					<p>
						Select the integration you wish to use (i.e. Votebuilder
						/ VAN), and click the refresh button at the far right of
						the screen.
					</p><p>

							style="width: 97.08%; max-width: 100%; "
						/>
					</p>
				</li><li>
					Browse for the correct list under the <i
						><b>Choose a list</b></i
					> menu, then press<i><b> Save.</b></i>
				</li><li>
					Review the upload notifications for processing notes.
				</li>
			</ol><p>
				When you are finished, click the <i
					><b>SAVE AND GOTO NEXT SECTION</b></i
				> button.
			</p><p>
				<b
					>Note: Once you start the campaign, you will not be able to
					modify or add to the contact list.</b
				>
			</p><br /><h3><b>Step 5: Optional — Filter Landlines</b></h3><h3>
				<b
					>Filtering landlines or otherwise un-textable numbers will
					cost $.0025 (1/4 cent) per phone number, but as long as more
					than a third of your phone numbers are likely to be invalid,
					it will save you money: It&#39;s cheaper to look up a phone
					number and throw it out for 1/4 cent than text that number
					at 1 cent/segment! If you&#39;re pretty sure your phone
					numbers are valid, feel free to skip this section.
				</b>
			</h3><h3>
				<b
					>Note: Phone number lookups are charged only once per
					contact cell for your entire organization. If a contact
					existed on a previous campaign and the Filter Landlines
					feature was used, you will not be charged an additional
					$.0025 to look up the same cell a second time.</b
				>
			</h3><br /><p>
				For more information, see <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/118-filter-landlines"
					target="_blank">Filter Landlines</a
				>.
			</p><br /><h3>
				Step 6: Resolve any overlapping contacts with other campaigns
			</h3><p>
				If you have uploaded contacts who also appear as contacts within
				other campaigns, those campaigns are listed in the <b
					>Contact Overlap Management</b
				> window. Perform one of the following:
			</p><ul>
				<li>
					Leave the campaign with overlapping contacts in the list.
				</li><li>
					Select the overlapping contacts, then click the trash icon
					to remove those contacts from this new campaign.
				</li>
			</ul><br /><p>
				For more information, see <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/46-contact-overlap-management"
					>Contact Overlap Management</a
				>.
			</p><br /><h3>Step 7: Optional — Assign teams to the campaign</h3><p
			>
				Add teams to the campaign from the <b>Teams</b> window:
			</p><ol>
				<li>
					Click on the <i><b>Select teams</b></i> field and select the
					team name from the drop down menu.
				</li><li>
					<span>Optional</span>— Add additional teams by repeating the
					previous step.
				</li><li>
					<span>Optional</span>— Entirely restrict conversation
					assignment to members of the listed teams by toggling the
					switch on. Left off, the assignment will be <span
						>prioritized
					</span>for members of those teams but not <span
						>restricted</span
					>.
				</li>
			</ol><br /><p>
				For more information about creating a team, see <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/49-create-a-team"
					target="_blank">Create a Team</a
				>.
			</p><p>
				When you are finished, click the <i
					><b>SAVE AND GOTO NEXT SECTION</b></i
				> button.
			</p><br /><h3>
				Step 8: Optional — Set the assignment options for texters
			</h3><p>
				Assignment is best done through <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/111-auto-assignment"
					>auto-assignment</a
				> (see Step 10) or through manual assignment within Message Review.
				However, you have the option to manually assign a number of contacts
				to an individual texter while building the campaign. To do so:
			</p><ol>
				<li>Open the <b>Texters</b> window.</li><li>
					Search for the names of the texters. The texters must
					already exist in Spoke.
				</li><li>
					Specify the number of contacts to assign to each texter.
				</li><li>
					If you have selected multiple texters, you can split the
					remaining messages by using the <i
						><b>Split remaining unsent messages</b></i
					> toggle.
				</li>
			</ol><p>
				When you are finished, click the <b
					><i>SAVE AND GOTO NEXT SECTION</i></b
				> button.
			</p><br /><h3>
				Step 9: Create an interaction script for your texters
			</h3><p>
				To create an interaction script, follow the instructions in <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/43-create-interaction-script"
					>Create an Interaction Script</a
				>.
			</p><p>
				When you are finished, click the <i
					><b>SAVE AND GOTO NEXT SECTION</b></i
				> button.
			</p><br /><h3>
				Step 10: Create canned responses for supplementary FAQ
			</h3><p>To add a canned response:</p><ol>
				<li>Open the <b>Canned Responses</b> window.</li><li>
					Click <i><b>Add new canned response</b></i><b>.</b>
				</li><li>Enter a title for the canned response.</li><li>
					Write a script for the response:<ol>
						<li>Click the <i><b>Script</b></i> field.</li><li>
							Write your canned response.
						</li><li>
							Click <i><b>Done</b></i><span><b>.</b></span>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li><li>Click <i><b>Add Response</b></i>.</li><li>
					<span>Optional</span>— Add additional canned responses.
				</li>
			</ol><br /><p>
				For more information, see <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/47-canned-responses"
					>Canned Responses</a
				>.
			</p><p>
				When you are finished, click the <i
					><b>SAVE AND GOTO NEXT SECTION</b></i
				> button.
			</p><br /><h3>
				Step 11: Recommended — Set the auto-assignment option
			</h3><p>
				Turning on auto-assignment allows your texters to pick up the
				assignment automatically from the request form. By default,
				auto-assignment is turned off.
			</p><p>To turn on auto-assignment:</p><ol>
				<li>Open the <b>Autoassign Mode</b> window.</li><li>
					Turn the toggle on.
				</li><li>
					<span>Optional –</span>turn on the toggle to release
					unhandled replies after a certain period of time and enter
					the number of minutes in the <i><b>Idle Minutes</b></i> field.
				</li>
			</ol><br /><p>
				For more information, see <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/111-auto-assignment"
					>Auto-Assignment</a
				>.
			</p><p>
				When you are finished, click the <i
					><b>SAVE AND GOTO NEXT SECTION</b></i
				> button.
			</p><br /><h3>Step 12: Start the campaign</h3><p>
				Before you start the campaign, double-check the previous steps
				to ensure you have properly entered and saved the campaign
				details. When you are ready to start the campaign, click the <i
					><b>Start this Campaign</b></i
				> button in the top right.
