			<p>
				You can utilize
				<strong>auto-assignment</strong> to easily and automatically distribute
				texting assignments to your texters, without needing to manually
				divide texts or replenish assignments when texters run out of messages.
				This keeps texts flowing to texters who are able to send more messages
				without overburdening administrators with tedious assignment and
				reassignment tasks.
			</p><p>
				There are three steps to set up auto-assignment for a campaign:
			</p><p>
				<strong>1. Enable Auto-Assignment:</strong>Click <strong
					>Autoassign Mode</strong
				> at the bottom of your campaign settings page, then toggle the top
				switch to enable autoassign.&nbsp;
			</p><blockquote>
				<strong>Note:</strong>Toggling the bottom switch will
				automatically release unhandled replies to the <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form"
					>request form</a
				> after a pre-set period of time (for example, 30 minutes). This
				can be a helpful feature down the road, but if you're just learning
				how to manage auto-assignment, we recommend keeping if toggled off.
			</blockquote><p>

			</p><p>
				<strong>2. Turn on the Request Form:</strong>Click <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/66-manage-assignment-control"
					target="_blank"><strong>Assignment Control</strong></a
				><strong>&nbsp;</strong>on&nbsp;the administration <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards"
					target="_blank">dashboard</a
				>, then toggle the switch to enable assignment. Set the
				assignment type (initials or replies) and the maximum number of
				messages a texter can request per assignment. This will activate
				the <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form"
					target="_blank">request form</a
				> for your texters, allowing them to request assignments.

					alt=""
					style="display: block; margin: auto;"
				/>
			</p><p>
				<strong>3. Set Up&nbsp;</strong><strong
					>Auto-Approval:
				</strong>Click <strong>Settings</strong> on the administration dashboard,
				then select <strong>Auto Approve</strong>beneath "Default Text
				Request Auto-Approval Level." This will make it so that when
				texters request an assignment via the request form, that
				assignment is automatically approved in a matter of seconds. If
				you wish to have administrators or <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/6-user-roles"
					target="_blank">Supervolunteers</a
				> manually approved requests, you can set this option for <strong
					>Approval Required</strong
				>. (We recommend&nbsp;using Auto Approve in most cases.)&nbsp;
			</p><blockquote>
				<strong>Note:</strong> You only need to set Auto Approve as your
				default setting once. Once set, all future texters invited to your
				organization will be set to have their assignments automatically
				approved. However, changing the default setting does not change the
				auto-approval level of texters already in your organization. You
				can change this setting on an individual basis by going to the
				<strong>People</strong>window within the administration <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards"
					target="_blank">dashboard</a
				>.
