			<h2 class="text-center">Create Interaction Script</h2>

			<p>
				The interaction&nbsp;script is where you determine the structure
				and message of your campaign.
			</p><h4><em>To create an interaction script:</em></h4><p>
				1. Select your campaign from the <strong>Campaign</strong> page of
				the administration <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards"
					target="_blank">dashboard</a
				>.
			</p><p>
				2. Select the <strong>Interactions</strong>window from the
				campaign settings page.
			</p><p>
				3. Write an initial message that will be sent to all of your
				campaign contacts:
			</p><ul>
				<li>
					Click the&nbsp;<strong>Script Version 1&nbsp;</strong>field.
				</li>
				<li>
					Enter an initial message; use dynamic script as appropriate,
					for example, you may want to begin with something like, "Hi
					&lcub; firstName &rcub;, it's &lcub;texterFirstName&rcub;
					with..." As of 2022, you will need to include opt out
					language like "<strong>Reply STOP to opt out</strong>" at
					the end of your message to ensure deliverability.&nbsp;
				</li>
				<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Done</strong>.</li>
				<li>
					Click the <strong>Question</strong> field and write a survey
					question. You must have a survey question to add survey responses.
					Only texters can see the survey question.
				</li>
			</ul><p>

				/>
			</p><p>
				4. Create survey responses for your texters to navigate their
				conversations:
			</p><ul>
				<li>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Add a Response</strong>button.</li>
				<li>
					Click the <strong>Answer</strong>field and write an answer
					to your previous survey question. Texters will be able to
					select this survey answer to log data and access the
					prepared response script. Only texters see the survey answer
					itself; contacts will only see the script.
				</li>
				<li>
					Click the&nbsp;<strong>Script Version 1</strong>&nbsp;field.
				</li>
				<li>
					Enter a survey response script that will automatically
					populate when a texter selects the survey answer.&nbsp;
				</li>
				<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Done</strong>.</li>
				<li>
					If you include an additional question in your survey
					response script, you can add a new survey question by
					clicking the <b style="background-color: initial;"
						>Question
					</b>field and writing a new question.
				</li>
			</ul><p>

				/>
			</p><p>
				5. Repeat step 4, adding survey responses to the question posed
				in your initial message. If you include additional questions
				under these survey response, make sure to add survey responses
				nested under those questions as well.
			</p><p>
				6. Click&nbsp; <strong>Save</strong>.&nbsp;
			</p><blockquote>
				Note #1: When building campaigns with multiple survey questions,
				make sure you are adding responses under the appropriate
				question. You can use
				<a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/114-script-preview"
					target="_blank"
					style="font-style: italic;">Script Preview</a
				> to double-check your work and easily view your question and response
				trees.
			</blockquote><blockquote>
				<em style="background-color: initial;"
					>Note #2: You are able to write multiple versions of any
					survey script; these are then randomly distributed across
					conversations. This can be a way to a/b test different
					messages or to minimize the chance your texts are flagged as
					spam by cell carriers<br />
				</em>

				<em style="background-color: initial;"
					>Note # 3:&nbsp;When writing a script, you can see the
					estimated number of segments per text message, as well&nbsp;</em
				>
				<em style="background-color: initial;"
					>as the number of characters left in the current segment.
					This can help you estimate the&nbsp;</em
