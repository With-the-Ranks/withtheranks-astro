			<p>
				Once you've built and launched a campaign and all your initial
				messages have been sent, you may want to consider periodically
				releasing unhandled replies from inactive texters and making
				them available to active texters via the <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form"
					target="_blank">request form</a
				>. It's easy for texters to forget to check their workflows
				regularly enough to make sure they are promptly responding to
				all of their assigned contacts. Releasing unhandled replies
				allows you to ensure that the people you're texting aren't
				waiting too long to get a response!&nbsp;
			</p><blockquote>
				<strong>Note:</strong>Make sure you're familiar with
				<a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/111-auto-assignment"
					target="_blank">auto-assignment</a
				> before reading this article. You will need to be using auto-assignment
				for releasing unhandled replies to work properly.
			</blockquote><p>
				There are two ways to release unhandled replies: manually or
				automatically.
			</p><h3>Manually Releasing Unhandled Replies</h3><h4>
				Across All Campaigns
			</h4><p>
				To release unhandled replies across <em>all</em>of your
				campaigns simultaneously, go to the <strong
					>Campaigns
				</strong>page of your administration <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards"
					target="_blank">dashboard</a
				> and click the <strong>Release Unhandled Replies</strong>button
				in the top right hand corner.&nbsp;
			</p><p>

				/>
			</p><p>
				You'll then be prompted to choose how long conversations much
				have been idle for in order to qualify for being released. For
				example, if you select 1 hour, then only conversations that have
				been waiting at least an hour for a response will be released to
				the <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form"
					target="_blank">request form</a
				>, while newer conversations will remain in their existing
				texters' workflows. This ensures that active texters are not
				getting their conversations taken away while they're still
				working on them! When you're ready to move forward, click
				the&nbsp;<strong>Release</strong>&nbsp;button.
			</p><p>

				/>
			</p><h4>One Campaign at a Time</h4><p>
				To release unhandled replies on just one campaign,&nbsp;go to
				the&nbsp;<strong>Campaigns</strong>&nbsp;page of your
				administration <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards"
					>dashboard</a
				> and&nbsp;select the three vertical dots to the right of the campaign
				in question to pull up the menu of <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/59-campaign-actions"
					target="_blank">campaign actions</a
				>, then select <strong style="background-color: initial;"
					>Release Unreplied Conversations</strong
				>. Again, you'll be prompted&nbsp;to choose how long
				conversations much have been idle for in order to qualify for
				being released. Choose a time and click <strong
					style="background-color: initial;">Execute Operation</strong
				>.
			</p><p>
				<img
					src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/611312f9b37d837a3d0e295d/file-cqod9Q2xup.png"
				/>
			</p><h3>Automatically Releasing Unhandled Replies</h3><p>
				To automatically release unhandled replies to the <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/110-request-form"
					target="_blank">request form</a
				>, go to the campaign editor page of the campaign in question
				and open the <strong>Autoassign Mode</strong>window, then toggle
				the <em>second</em>switch on. Again, this will prompt to
				choose&nbsp;how long conversations much have been idle for in
				order to qualify for being released. But in this case, Spoke
				will <em>automatically</em>release unhandled replies according
				to that time interval for as long as the toggle is turned on.
				When you're ready, click <strong>Save</strong>.&nbsp;
			</p><p>
				<img
					src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5d4878eb2c7d3a330e3c1b86/images/6113154c6ffe270af2a97a75/file-hDyDki3SkS.png"
				/>
			</p><p>
				This option can be helpful if you want to prioritize making sure
				your contacts get responded to as quickly as possible and when
				it's not important for the same texter to be interacting with
				the same contact for the duration of the conversation.&nbsp;
			</p><p>
				However, using this option means you'll have little real-time
				information about how many replies you have at any one moment,
				because they'll constantly be getting automatically unassigned.
				Also, texters may not like getting their replies so promptly
				taken away. If you're new to using <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/111-auto-assignment"
					target="_blank">auto-assignment</a
				>, we recommend&nbsp;starting by manually reassigning your
				unhandled replies and getting a feel for things before
				experimenting with automatically releasing them.
