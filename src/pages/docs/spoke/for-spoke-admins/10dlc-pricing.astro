			<h2>Spoke Rewired Pricing</h2><p>
				Spoke Rewired offers its lowest prices to organizations
				registered with 10DLC. We continue to support sending messages
				without registration at an additional cost (imposed by
				carriers).
			</p><p>
				Please refer to the <a
					href="https://www.politicsrewired.com/pricing"
					target="_blank">Spoke Rewired pricing page on our website</a
				> for more information.
			</p><h2>Non-compliance with 10DLC messaging requirements</h2><p>
				Carriers may levy the following types of fees for non-compliance
				with 10DLC messaging requirements:
			</p><p><strong>Content Violation</strong></p><p>
				T-Mobile may charge a $10,000 fee for <strong
					>each unique instance</strong
				> of content violation by a sender. Content violations are
				usually SHAFT violations (Sex, Hate, Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco)
				but would also include spam messages or phishing attempts. We
				are not especially worried about this type of content being sent
				by the customers we have chosen to work with, however, it is
				very important that all texting program directors familiarize
				themselves with these violation types!
			</p><p><strong>Message Routing</strong></p><p>
				Additional fees are assessed for message routing violations on
				the network. Spoke Rewired was built with compliance in mind
				from day one and you will not have to worry about these kinds of
				fees as a customer.
			</p><p>
				If, however, we find that you have intentionally circumvented
				the safeguards built into our software, we will pass on any
				message routing non-compliance fees.
