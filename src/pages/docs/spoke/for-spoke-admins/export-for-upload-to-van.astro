			<p>
				The "Export for VAN" feature allows you to export survey
				responses collected during a Spoke campaign in a format that may
				be easier for upload back into VAN.
			</p><p>
				From the campaign page, <strong>select Export for VAN:</strong>

			</p><p>This will then open the Export for VAN dialog.</p><p>
				Select which field the VAN ID lives in. <strong
					>If you are using our VAN integration, you should leave the
					default of "external_id".</strong
				> If you uploaded contacts via a CSV, you'll need to select the heading
				of the column in the CSV that contained your VAN IDs. For example,
				this could be <em>van_id:</em>

				/>
			</p><p>
				In most cases, you'll only want to include survey responses for
				contacts to whom you actually sent a message. However, you have
				a choice to include all contacts, regardless of whether or not
				they have been messaged. To do so, toggle on <em
					>Include unmessaged contacts.</em
				>
			</p><p>
				<strong
					>After clicking the <em>Export</em>button, you'll receive an
					email
				</strong>containing a link to download the export.&nbsp;<br />
