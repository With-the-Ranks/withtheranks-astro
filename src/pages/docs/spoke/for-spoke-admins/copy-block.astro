				When you're
				<a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/43-create-interaction-script"
					target="_blank">creating an interaction script</a
				> for your campaign, you can easily copy and paste script blocks
				within or between campaigns. This can be helpful if you want to add
				generic survey scripts you already have written elsewhere (e.g.,
				Wrong Number) or if you're building multiple complex survey trees
				within a single campaign, each with the same or similar structure
				and content.
			</p><h5><em>To copy and paste a script block:</em></h5><p>
				1. Navigate to the campaign that contains the script block you
				wish to copy.
			</p><p>
				2. Open the
				<strong>Interactions</strong>window&nbsp;within the campaign
				settings page.
			</p><p>
				3. Click the
				<strong>Copy Block</strong>button within the script block you
				wish to copy.

			</p><p>
				4. Navigate to the campaign within which you want to paste the
				copied block. If you're copying and pasting in the same
				campaign, just stay where you are!
			</p><p>
				5. Find the survey question that your copied block will be
				answering and click the&nbsp;<strong
					>+ Paste Block
				</strong>button immediately underneath the script block that
				contains the survey question. The copied script block will
				appear immediately below the survey question.

				Note #1: You can copy and paste entire survey trees (i.e., a
				script block with a survey question and all the the script
				blocks with survey answers nested underneath it) by copying the
				parent script block containing the survey question. When you
				paste the block, it will cary over not only the parent script
				block, but also all of its "children" blocks nested beneath it.
