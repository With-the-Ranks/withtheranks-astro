			<p>
				<strong>10DLC</strong> (short for <strong
					>10 Digit Long Code</strong
				>) is a new policy from cell phone carriers for organizations
				and businesses that use software to send text messages. The
				10DLC scheme requires organizations and businesses to register
				with cell phone carriers and describe their usage before using
				software like Spoke Rewired to send SMS and MMS messages.
			</p><h2>I’m a Spoke customer, what do I need to do?</h2><p>
				Spoke Rewired fully supports sending messages with 10DLC. To
				take advantage of our lowest prices and improved deliverability,
				you should register your Spoke organization for a 10DLC brand.
			</p><p>
				<strong>Please see</strong><a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/132-transitioning-to-10dlc"
					><strong>Adopting 10DLC</strong></a
				><strong> to start the registration process.</strong>
			</p><p>
				While carriers have not implemented a strict deadline for
				registering for 10DLC, they have begun to charge higher fees and
				impose stricter filters for unregistered messages. As a result,
				we highly recommend all existing organizations register for
				10DLC as soon as possible.
			</p><p>
				If the time required to complete registration is an issue, you
				can continue to send unregistered traffic at a higher cost per
				message while undergoing the registration process. As soon as
				you complete the registration process and your registration is
				vetted and approved, we will transition you to our registered
				pricing plan so you can take advantage of our lowest message
				prices.
			</p><p>
				We are committed to supporting you throughout the registration
				process, and offer registration and ongoing 10DLC enrollment at
				no additional cost. Contact us at any time at <a
					href="mailto:support@spokerewired.com"
					>support@spokerewired.com</a
				>.
			</p><h2>I’m new to Spoke, how does this affect me?</h2><p>
				If you need to send messages as quickly as possible, you can
				begin sending unregistered messages while starting the 10DLC
				registration process. As soon as you complete the registration
				process and your registration is vetted and approved, we will
				transition you to our registered pricing plan so you can take
				advantage of our lowest message prices.

			</table><h2>History and background</h2><p>
				Before the development of 10DLC, cell phone carriers discouraged
				organizations and businesses from using software to send
				messages from local phone numbers (in carrier jargon: long
				codes) to other local phone numbers. Carriers pushed
				organizations to instead purchase <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_code"
					>short code numbers</a
				> or <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-free_telephone_number"
					>toll-free numbers</a
				>, which required lengthy and expensive setup procedures and
				opt-in procedures.
			</p><p>
				In the 2010s, software was developed to avoid these extensive
				setup costs and procedures. Instead of sending messages from
				short-code or toll-free numbers, this software provided ways to
				send text messages from individual cell phones to other cell
				phones. This concept, known as peer-to-peer texting, allowed
				political campaigns and organizers to quickly contact voters and
				volunteers. Eventually, this ecosystem developed into modern
				texting software, which allows users to directly send text
				messages via internet telecom services without managing
				individual cell phones.
			</p><p>
				The advent of software-based texting lowered technical and
				financial barriers for sending texts, leading to an increase in
				spam. In response, cell phone carriers introduced the 10DLC
				policy to provide a sanctioned platform for organizations and
				businesses to send SMS and MMS messages using long codes. The
				stated objective of the 10DLC program is to protect consumers
				from unwanted spam while still allowing businesses to better
				connect with their customers.
			</p><p>10DLC is intended to reduce spam in two ways:</p><ol>
				<li>
					Organizations register themselves as a 10DLC brand, and all
					messages sent on 10DLC channels will be associated with this
					brand. This registration costs money and deanonymizes
					message traffic, increasing the risk to spammers.
				</li><li>
					Increased costs to send 10DLC messages and increasing
					penalty fees on unregistered messages. A small increase in
					price can eliminate spammer profits, and spammers aiming to
					avoid 10DLC registration face even higher costs.
				</li>
