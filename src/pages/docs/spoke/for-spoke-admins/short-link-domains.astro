			<h3>What is a Short Link Domain?&nbsp;</h3><p>
				A short link domain is a&nbsp;<b
					style="background-color: initial;">shorter</b
				>&nbsp;version of a URL you intend to share.
			</p><p>
				Custom short link domains let you minimize the chance that your
				messages with links are blocked by carriers. Commonly used short
				links&nbsp;(e.g., bit.ly, tinyurl.com, etc.) as well as commonly
				used link domains (e.g., ActBlue, Mobilize, ActionKit)&nbsp;are
				some of the more common reasons that carriers choose to block
				messages, which they interpret as spam.
			</p><p>
				When trying to send out links of this type, some clients have
				found success using the link shortening service <a
					href="https://www.rebrandly.com/">Rebrandly</a
				>. However, it's important (and worthwhile) that you buy a
				custom domain from them rather than using their default domain
				of <em>rebrand.ly</em>. Links that say rebrand.ly, bit.ly, or
				tiny.url in them perform poorly. Create a custom domain using
				.me, .us, or another less common URL suffix and name the domain
				something legible, like rewired.us. Purchasing a domain can cost
				as little as $2 and will boost your deliverability
				considerably.&nbsp;
			</p><p>
				For even further deliverability assurance, use script versions
				to rotate links. In the interactions section of your campaign
				builder, click ADD SCRIPT VERSION. Using <a
					href="https://www.rebrandly.com/">Rebrandly</a
				>, you can set up multiple short links to send out the same
				link. See our example below using the links
				GNDchampion.me/1,&nbsp;GNDchampion.me/2, and GNDchampion.me/3.
				While these example links all lead to the same donate page,
				having 3 script versions will alternate which link is sent out,
				improving deliverability.&nbsp;

			</p><h3>Setting up Rotating Short Link Domains in Spoke&nbsp;</h3><p
			>
				<em
					><strong
						>UPDATE: "Short Link Domains" is no longer a default
						Spoke feature, but we can enable this feature if your
						organization is texting out 50,000-100,000 messages per
						day with links and is running into deliverability
						issues.&nbsp;</strong
					></em
				><em style="background-color: initial;"
					>If you think this would be a good solution for your use
					case, please email support@spokerewired.com</em
				>
			</p><p>
				You can add to a list of short link domains from the
				administration <a
					href="https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards"
					target="_blank">dashboard</a
				>. When a texter sends a message that includes a shortened link,
				Spoke uses this list to automatically detect and replace the
				short link's domain with another domain in the list. Spoke
				cycles through the domains in this list to spread out usage of
				the domains. The <em>maximum</em><em>usage</em> setting for a domain
				specifies the number of times Spoke will use that domain before moving
				onto the next one.
			</p><p>

				/>
			</p><p>
				You must set up the short links outside of the Spoke platform,
				and they must resolve to the same end location for the domain
				replacement to work. Spoke can detect only the domains you've
				added to the short&nbsp;link domain list; URLs with other
				domains will not be replaced.
			</p><blockquote>
				<strong>Note:</strong> If you don't set up short links outside of
				the platform, the links you send out will not work as expected. If
				you have questions or concerns, contact&nbsp;support@spokerewired.com.
