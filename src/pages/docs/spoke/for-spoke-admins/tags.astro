			<p>
				Tags are used by texters to log additional data about a
				conversation or contact. Tags can be applied to any conversation
				across all of your organization's campaigns and are typically
				used to capture information that doesn't fit neatly in your
				interaction scripts.&nbsp;
			</p><p>
				For example, a
				<em>Spanish</em>&nbsp;tag would allow you to mark people
				replying in Spanish as Spanish-speakers, giving you the
				information needed to contact them in the future in their
				preferred language. A <em>Volunteer Lead</em>&nbsp;would allow
				you to&nbsp;mark people expressing interest in volunteering,
				enabling you to follow up and recruit them later.

			</h4><p>
				You can also create a custom escalation tag that not only logs
				data but removes the conversation from a texter's workflow, and
				makes it uniquely available to a specialized <a

					target="_blank">team</a
				> for assignment.&nbsp;To do this, just un-check <strong
